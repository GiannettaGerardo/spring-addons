## Breaking News

`7.5.4` introduces some support classes to provide with [`RestClient` and `WebClient` builders](https://github.com/ch4mpy/spring-addons/tree/master/spring-addons-starter-oidc#1-3-2) pre-configured with:
- a base URI taken from properties (to be easily changed from a deployment to another)
- OAuth2 authorization, either by using the`(Reactive)OAuth2AuthorizedClientManager` and a registration-id, or by forwarding the token from incoming requests (possible only in `oauth2ResourceServer`)

This REST support classes can also be used to get auto-generated `@HttpExchange` proxy beans:
```java
@HttpExchange(accept = MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON_VALUE)
public interface KeycloakAdminApi {

    @GetExchange(url = "/{realm}/users/count")
    Long getTotalUsersCount(@PathVariable(name = "realm") String realm);
}
```
```java
@Bean
KeycloakAdminApi keycloakAdminApi(SpringAddonsRestClientSupport restSupport) {
    return restSupport.restClientService("keycloak-admin-api", KeycloakAdminApi.class);
}
```
Where `keycloak-admin-api` is an entry under `com.c4-soft.springaddons.oidc.client.rest`:
```yaml
com:
  c4-soft:
    springaddons:
      oidc:
        client:
          rest:
            keycloak-admin-api:
              base-uri: ${keycloak-base-uri}/admin/realms
              auth2-registration-id: backend-with-client-credentials
spring:
  security:
    oauth2:
      client:
        provider:
          keycloak:
           issuer-uri: ${issuer}
        registration:
          backend-with-client-credentials:
            provider: keycloak
            authorization-grant-type: client_credentials
            client-id: keycloak-admin-api-consumer
            client-secret: ${keycloak-admin-api-consumer-secret}
```
Note that `backend-with-client-credentials` set as value for `auth2-registration-id` is an entry under `spring.security.oauth2.client.registration`. **And that's it, `KeycloakAdminApi` can be injected in any `@Component`**. The implementation using a `RestClient` or `WebClient` is generated by spring (a bit like `@Repositoy` interfaces for those used to Spring Data).

`7.5.0` comes with an important refactoring of the way JWT decoder(s) configuration is resolved. This greatly eases ["dynamic" multi-tenant scenarios implementation](https://github.com/ch4mpy/spring-addons/tree/master/spring-addons-starter-oidc#1-1-4). The only noticeable breaking change is the removal of `SpringAddonsOidcProperties::getOpProperties`. This feature is now the responsibility of the newly introduced `OpenidProviderPropertiesResolver`. The default implementation resolves properties with an exact match on issuer (just as `getOpProperties` was doing). As usual, auto-configured bean backs-off if you expose one to use another properties resolving strategy.

**Important warning for those using `@WithJwt` (and since `7.3.0`, `@WithMockJwtAuth`) but not `spring-addons-starter-oidc`**: you should expose your JWT converter as a bean. See [`spring-addons-oauth2-test` README](https://github.com/ch4mpy/spring-addons/tree/master/spring-addons-oauth2-test) for details.

## [OIDC starter](https://github.com/ch4mpy/spring-addons/tree/master/spring-addons-starter-oidc)

With `spring-addons-starter-oidc`, you might need 0 Java conf, even in scenarios like:
- accepting tokens issued by several trussted authorization servers
- mapping authorities from a variety of claims
- needing custom OAuth2 redirection URI or HTTP status
- having per environment CORS configuration (not allowing the same origins in staging and prod for instance)
- exposing CSRF token as a cookie accessible to a single-page application
- logging out from an authorization server not strictly implementing RP-Initiated Logout (case of Auth0 and Amazon Cognito for instance)
- adding extra parameters to authorization or token requests (like the `audience` required by Auth0)

## Unit & Integration Testing With Security

Testing access control requires to configure the test security context.  For that, `spring-security-test` provides with `MockMvc` request post-processors and `WebTestClient` mutators, but this can work only in the context of a request, which limits its usage to controllers.

To test any type of `@Component` (`@Controller`, off course, but also `@Service` and `@Repository`) there are  only two options:
- build tests security context by yourself and populate it with stubbed / mocked authentications
- use annotations to do it for you (this is where [spring-addons-oauth2-test](https://github.com/ch4mpy/spring-addons/tree/master/spring-addons-oauth2-test) jumps in)
